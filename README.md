# Just a little something about me 
I'm a software developer from Akute, Ogun State, Nigeria.

My journey into tech began in 2019, back in SS2. While most of my peers already had a clear vision of their career paths, I was still exploring. I had always been fascinated by technology—from phones to computers to anything innovative—but I hadn’t yet figured out what exactly I wanted to do.

One day, a teacher asked me the big question: “What do you want to become?” I didn’t have an answer. Later that evening, I watched the series The Flash and saw Cisco and Felicity working on some really cool tech. That was my lightbulb moment—I knew I wanted to become a software developer.

Since then, I’ve been on a continuous journey of learning, building, and growing in the world of software development.

```Hopefully, one day I’ll build the next generation of life-changing technology```
